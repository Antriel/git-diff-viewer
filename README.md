A simple app for viewing and searching the results of `git diff`.
- Compare CWD vs HEAD.
- Compare against commits.
- Search for a string within the added/removed lines.
- Quickly navigate to the change in your editor via a button.

My main motivation for this was that I sometimes make a mess of a commit with scattered `TODO` comments that I want to finish before pushing, but searching for `TODO` also shows ones that are not new changes, and are meant to stay (potentially forever).

This was a 2 day project that took a week, as my first test of LLM enhanced development (using Claude Code).
